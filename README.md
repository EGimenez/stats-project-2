# stats-project-2

This project implements the EM algorithm for Factor Analysis
It is divided into three main blocks
· FactorAnalysisModel: Probability calculation and expectations are performed
· FactorAnalysisOptimizer: Helper functions to interface with scipy minimizer
· FactorAnalysisDataGeneratingProcess: Given a set of parameters, generates n samples of data

Finally, main.py put everything together
